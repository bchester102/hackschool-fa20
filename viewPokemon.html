         <p>Photosynthesis occurs across its body under the sun. The shell on its back is actually hardened soil.</p>
         <h2>Mudkip</h2>
         <img src="https://assets.pokemon.com/assets/cms2/img/pokedex/full/258.png">
         <p>The fin on Mudkip’s head acts as highly sensitive radar. Using this fin to sense movements of water and air, this Pokémon can determine what is taking place around it without using its eyes.</p>
